# hello-world

Hi Everyone,
I am Muhammad Noman. I want to create a web application. This application should get images from a remote computer (server) at regular intervals and show on a web page. On the remote server I will create a folder which will contain updated images. After making this web application I need to put it on my website or blog. This web application should also contain a login page for providing authorized access to the page which contains updated images. Please help me doing that. Thanks!
